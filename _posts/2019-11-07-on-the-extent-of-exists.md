> "I'm usually not one to pick fights, but you've really crossed the line this time. If there's one thing this place doesn't need, it's your friends and their extreme lack of sympathy. A sorry drunken soliloquy; do us a favor and stumble out the front door disgracefully. If you're trying to make an exit, then I'm sure you've figured out you're a problem that this place could live without. I'm not sure what you had hoped for, but if you're just trying to fit in, quit it. Trust me, you're not as old as you'd like to think. I'm usually not one to pick fights, but you've really gone and done it this time. It's not what you do, it's who you are. You've really gone and crossed the line this time."
